A blood donation application built with flutter as the front end and firestore as the backend

## Functionalities
1. It offers authorization with either email and password or google. It has the feature to change the password as well.

2. It allows the users to enlist as donors, ask for blood donations, and search for blood donors according to the city and blood type.

3. The donors would be asked their name, phone numbers, blood type and gender, and status (Normal or corona recovered). If they're corona recovered they would be asked to enter their recovery date. Donors will have the option to either hide or show their number. If they want to hide their number the people could always contact them through the built-in messaging service. 

4. The blood donation request would ask the patient's name, the status of blood required, gender, details, phone number, and type of blood required. The person requesting the blood would have the option to either show their phone number or hide it. Users can only post on the app every 15 minutes in order to prevent spam. 

5. People can also search for blood donation requests in their own city

6. The map shows the location of blood banks and hospitals near them where they could navigate by opening the marker externally in google maps. 

7. The users could view their own posts in the drawer.

8. The posts would have the option to chat, phone, or both according to how the user posted their request
